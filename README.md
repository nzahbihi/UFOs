In order to refresh after clearing out their results, they can either click the "UFO Sightings" link at the top, or click away after clearing out the inputs, to refresh the table.

## Summary
This webpage is useful for any curious users to review recorded UFO events and, as a result, make a determination for themselves regarding UFOs. However, one drawback to this webpage, is that the data is limited. This data reflects a short period of time, and as such, there is a small quantity of data. If the user has a strong curiosity regarding UFOs, it may be beneficial to provide a larger dataset for the user to filter through.

That being said, we have identified two recommendations to make regarding the continued development of this webpage. One recommendation is to make the filter engine more flexible in terms of what the user is inputting. Currently, the user must input their query to the specific format of the data table. The filter engine could be revamped to disregard the format of the user's input (e.g. random capitalization).

Another recommendation is to standardize the data format. If the data was formatted to a standard (e.g. proper capitalization, the time duration has one standard unit), the presentation of the webpage will be neater and more readable to the user.
